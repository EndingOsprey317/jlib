# JLIB
## About

This is the **JLIB** project.
It is a key module for python.
It contains many ease-of-use features that I believe are commonly used when writing python files.
The **JLIB** module file can also be run by itself, displaying a description of the classes contained within the **JLIB** module from [jlib.description()](https://github.com/EndingOsprey317/jlib#jlibdescription).
All functions within this project, if you write "!pass" as its first argument, will pass all code contained within the function.

## jlib.description()

This function writes out a list of all functions into the terminal.

_JLIB: description  
--jlib.description(): display a help description of all classes in the JLIB module_
