# JLIB
## About

This is the **JLIB** project.
It is a key module for python.
It contains many ease-of-use features that I believe are commonly used when writing python files.
The **JLIB** module file can also be run by itself, displaying a description of the classes contained within the **JLIB** module from jlib.description.
